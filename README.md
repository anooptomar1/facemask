## Overview
The rounded profile picture is a design trend that's becoming standard, especially in the mobile space.  The challenge is that source profile photo data is generally rectangular, which means that there's no guarantee that cropping this into a round frame will yield good results without manual input from the user.

This class builds upon Apple's Vision framework introduced in iOS 11, which uses computer vision to identify a crop within a larger photo that is ideal for a round profile.
